# 🐛 Damage Resistance & Poison Fix

## Issues Fixed

### **1. Damage Resistance Not Working** ✅

**Problem:**
- Physical attacks were dealing full damage to Troll (should be 50% reduced)
- Magic attacks were dealing full damage to Dark Wizard (should be 50% reduced)
- `resolveAttack()` was being called without damage type and resistance parameters

**Root Cause:**
In `executePlayerAction()`, the `resolveAttack()` calls were missing the required parameters:
```javascript
// WRONG - Missing parameters
resolveAttack(action.damage, enemy.defense);

// CORRECT - With all parameters
resolveAttack(action.damage, enemy.defense, player.itemEffects, 
              damageType, targetResistances, hitChanceModifier, 
              player.statusEffects);
```

**Fix Applied:**
Updated both attack paths in `executePlayerAction()`:
1. Single target attacks (`targetId`)
2. Multi-target attacks (`all_enemies`)

**Now Working:**
```javascript
const damageType = action.damageType || 'physical';
const targetResistances = enemy.resistances || [];
const hitChanceModifier = action.hitChanceModifier || 0;

const { hit, crit, damage: finalDamage } = resolveAttack(
  action.damage || 0, 
  enemy.currentDefense || enemy.defense, 
  player.itemEffects, 
  damageType, 
  targetResistances, 
  hitChanceModifier, 
  player.statusEffects
);
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Knight's Slash (15 physical) vs Troll → ~6-9 damage (50% reduction)
- Wizard's Fireball (25 magic) vs Dark Wizard → ~10-15 damage (50% reduction)
- Resistance icons show on enemy health bars
- Resistance info shows in target selection

### **2. Poison Status Effect Not Applying** ✅

**Problem:**
- Rogue's Poison ability only dealt initial damage
- Poison DoT (damage over time) was not being applied
- Code was checking for `action.dot` instead of `action.poison`

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// WRONG
if (action.dot) {
  applyStatusEffect(enemy, 'poison', 3, player.username);
}

// CORRECT
if (action.poison) {
  applyStatusEffect(enemy, 'poison', 3, player.username);
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
Changed the condition from `action.dot` to `action.poison` to match the ability definition.

**Now Working:**
- Rogue's Poison ability applies poison status effect
- Enemy takes 5 damage per turn for 3 turns
- Poison icon (☠️) appears above enemy
- Combat log shows "Enemy is poisoned!"

## 🧪 **Testing the Fixes**

### **Test Damage Resistance:**

**Knight vs Troll:**
```
Knight uses Slash (15 physical damage)
Troll has physical resistance
Expected: ~6-9 damage (50% reduction + variance)
```

**Wizard vs Dark Wizard:**
```
Wizard uses Fireball (25 magic damage)
Dark Wizard has magic resistance
Expected: ~10-15 damage (50% reduction + variance)
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Damage is reduced by ~50%
- ✅ Resistance icons show on enemies
- ✅ Target selection shows resistance info
- ✅ Combat log shows reduced damage

### **Test Poison Status Effect:**

**Rogue's Poison Ability:**
```
Round 1:
- Rogue uses Poison on Goblin
- Goblin takes initial damage (10 physical)
- Poison status applied (☠️ icon appears)

Round 2:
- Goblin takes 5 poison damage at start
- Poison duration: 2 rounds remaining

Round 3:
- Goblin takes 5 poison damage at start
- Poison duration: 1 round remaining

Round 4:
- Goblin takes 5 poison damage at start
- Poison expires
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ Initial damage dealt
- ✅ Poison status effect applied
- ✅ 5 damage per turn for 3 turns
- ✅ Purple poison icon shows
- ✅ Duration counts down
- ✅ Effect expires after 3 rounds

## 📊 **Damage Calculations**

### **With Resistance:**

**Knight's Slash vs Troll:**
```
Base: 15 physical damage
Resistance: 50% reduction → 7.5 damage
Variance (±20%): 6-9 damage
With Crit: 12-18 damage
```

**Wizard's Fireball vs Dark Wizard:**
```
Base: 25 magic damage
Resistance: 50% reduction → 12.5 damage
Variance (±20%): 10-15 damage
With Crit: 20-30 damage
```

### **Without Resistance:**

**Knight's Slash vs Goblin:**
```
Base: 15 physical damage
Variance (±20%): 12-18 damage
With Crit: 24-36 damage
```

**Wizard's Fireball vs Goblin:**
```
Base: 25 magic damage
Variance (±20%): 20-30 damage
With Crit: 40-60 damage
```

## 🎯 **Strategic Impact**

### **Resistance System:**

**Forces Tactical Choices:**
- Can't just spam same damage type
- Must adapt to enemy composition
- Rewards diverse party composition
- Encourages communication

**Team Coordination:**
```
vs Troll + Dark Wizard:
- Physical attackers focus Dark Wizard
- Magic casters focus Troll
- Buffs applied to appropriate damage dealers
```

### **Poison Status Effect:**

**Damage Over Time Value:**
```
Initial: 10 damage
DoT: 5 × 3 = 15 damage
Total: 25 damage over 4 rounds
```

**Strategic Use:**
- Apply to high-HP enemies
- Stacks with other damage
- Useful when can't focus fire
- Good for multi-enemy fights

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. **`games/rpg/server.js`**
   - Fixed `resolveAttack()` calls in `executePlayerAction()`
   - Added all required parameters (damage type, resistances, modifiers)
   - Fixed poison application (changed `action.dot` to `action.poison`)
   - Added slow application for completeness

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

### **Damage Resistance:**
- ✅ Troll takes ~50% from physical attacks
- ✅ Dark Wizard takes ~50% from magic attacks
- ✅ Resistance icons visible on enemies
- ✅ Target selection shows resistance info
- ✅ Combat log shows reduced damage numbers

### **Poison Status Effect:**
- ✅ Rogue's Poison applies poison status
- ✅ Enemy takes 5 damage per turn
- ✅ Lasts for 3 turns
- ✅ Purple poison icon shows
- ✅ Duration counts down
- ✅ Effect expires correctly

**Both critical bugs have been fixed! Damage resistances now work correctly, and poison status effects apply properly with damage over time.** ✅🐛🔧

**Players will now see appropriate damage reduction against resistant enemies and poison will deal its full DoT damage!** ⚔️☠️✨
