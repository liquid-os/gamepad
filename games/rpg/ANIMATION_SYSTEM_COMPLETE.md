## How the System Works

### Architecture

```
Server (server.js)
  ↓
Triggers animation event
  ↓
Host receives 'animateAction'
  {
    actorId: 'player_123',
    targetId: 'enemy_0',
    actionId: 'fireball',
    hit: true,
    crit: false,
    damage: 25
  }
  ↓
Animation plays (host-scene.js)
  1. Identify animation type
  2. Play appropriate animation
  3. Update sprites
  4. Show effects
  ↓
Combat log updates
  ↓
Health bars update
  ↓
Next action (2.5s delay)
```

### Animation Categories

Actions are automatically categorized:

```javascript
melee: ['slash', 'backstab', 'shield_bash', ...]
  → playMeleeAnimation()

projectile: ['arrow_shot', 'ice_spike', ...]
  → playProjectileAnimation()

spell: ['fireball', 'arcane_blast', ...]
  → playSpellAnimation()

support: ['heal', 'defend', 'bless', ...]
  → playSupportAnimation()
```

**No configuration needed** - actions automatically use correct animation!

### Sprite State System

```
Sprite States:
├── idle    → Default standing pose
├── attack  → Melee combat pose
├── cast    → Spellcasting/ranged pose
└── hurt    → Taking damage pose

Automatic switching:
  Melee action   → attack state
  Spell action   → cast state
  Take damage    → hurt state (brief)
  Otherwise      → idle state
```

## Using the Animated Host

### Quick Test (No Assets):

1. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **In browser, navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/games/rpg/client/host-scene.html
   ```

3. **You'll see:**
   - Purple gradient background
   - Emoji sprites (🛡️ 🧙 👹)
   - Working animations
   - Combat log

4. **Join with players and battle!**

### With Assets:

1. **Add background:**
   - Drop `forest.jpg` (1920x1080) into `assets/backgrounds/`
   - Refresh → Background appears!

2. **Add sprites:**
   - Drop `knight_idle.png` into `assets/sprites/`
   - Refresh → Knight sprite appears!

3. **Add more:**
   - Keep adding sprites as you create them
   - Each one improves the visual

## Animation Timing Breakdown

```

## Performance Optimizations

### Built-In:
- ✅ GPU-accelerated CSS transitions
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of effect elements
- ✅ Combat log limited to 20 entries
- ✅ Lazy loading of images
- ✅ Fallback to emoji (tiny file size)

### Image Optimization Tips:
- Compress PNGs (use TinyPNG.com)
- Use JPG for backgrounds
- Keep sprites under 50KB each
- Total assets under 5MB

## Customization Examples

### Change Animation Speed

```javascript
// In host-scene.js

// Faster melee (currently 400ms)
await sleep(200);  // Move toward target faster

// Slower projectile (currently 800ms)
projectile.style.transition = 'all 1.5s linear';

// Longer spell effect (currently 2000ms)
await sleep(3000);  // Effect visible longer
```

### Change Sprite Positions

```javascript
// In SPRITE_CONFIG

player: {
  startX: 100,        // Closer to left edge
  startYBase: 200,    // Higher on screen
  spacing: 160        // More space between
}
```

### Different Background Per Environment

Could add to server logic:
```javascript
// Future enhancement
const backgrounds = ['forest', 'cave', 'dungeon'];
const randomBg = backgrounds[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)];
// Send to host
```

## Integration with Existing Code

### Seamless Integration

The animated scene works with **all existing features**:
- ✅ Defense system
- ✅ Hit/miss mechanics
- ✅ Critical strikes
- ✅ Action delays
- ✅ HP updates
- ✅ Turn order
- ✅ Combat resolution

### No Breaking Changes

- Old UI host view still works
- Player screens unchanged
- Server logic enhanced (not replaced)
- Backward compatible
