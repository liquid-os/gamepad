# 🎁 Loot System & Combat Fixes

## Overview

I've fixed critical issues with the loot system, added a victory banner, implemented PNG icons for items, and added per-ability hit chance modifiers.

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Loot Screen End Screen Bug** ✅

**Problem:** Player devices were being sent to the end screen when combat ended, even during loot phase.

**Solution:**
- Removed `combatEnded` event from being sent to all players on victory
- Only send victory banner to host screen
- Players stay in combat phase during loot distribution
- Only show end screen after loot is complete or on defeat

**Before:**
```javascript
api.sendToAll('combatEnded', { result: 'victory' });
// Players immediately go to end screen
```

**After:**
```javascript
api.sendToHost('showVictoryBanner', { message: 'Victory!' });
// Only host sees banner, players stay in game
```

### 2. **Host Loot Screen Buttons** ✅

**Problem:** Roll/Pass buttons were showing on the host loot screen.

**Solution:**
- Removed action buttons from `loot-screen.html` (host view)
- Buttons only appear on player devices via `player.js`
- Host screen shows rolls and winner announcements only

**Host Screen Now Shows:**
- Item display with icon, name, description
- Timer bar
- Player status (who rolled/passed)
- Roll results
- Winner announcement

### 3. **Victory Banner** ✅

**Implementation:**
- Large golden banner appears on host screen
- "🎉 VICTORY! 🎉" text with animation
- Pop-in animation (scale + fade)
- Shows for 3 seconds
- Pop-out animation before loot screen
- Loot screen appears after banner fades

**Animation Details:**
```css
@keyframes victoryPopIn {
  0% { transform: scale(0.5); opacity: 0; }
  50% { transform: scale(1.1); opacity: 1; }
  100% { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}
```

**Visual Style:**
- Golden gradient background (#ffd700 → #ffed4e)
- White border
- Large text (5em)
- Glowing shadow effect
- Centered on screen

### 4. **PNG Item Icons** ✅

**Implementation:**
- All items now use PNG paths instead of emojis
- Automatic fallback to emoji if PNG fails to load
- Consistent icon display across all screens

**Item Icon Structure:**
```javascript
{
  icon: '/games/rpg/assets/items/health_potion.png',
  iconFallback: '🧪'
}
```

**Icon Paths:**
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/health_potion.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/vitality_ring.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/sharp_sword.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/fire_wand.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/assassin_hood.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/iron_armor.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/healer_staff.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/lightning_orb.png`
- `/games/rpg/assets/items/boots_swiftness.png`

**Fallback System:**
```javascript
img.onerror = () => {
  // Show emoji if PNG fails
  iconElement.textContent = item.iconFallback || '❓';
};
```

### 5. **Per-Ability Hit Chance Modifiers** ✅

**Implementation:**
- Abilities can now have custom hit chance modifiers
- Modifiers add/subtract from base hit chance
- Displayed in target selection

**Example Abilities:**
```javascript
// Knight's Slash - easier to hit (+10%)
{ 
  name: 'Slash', 
  damage: 15, 
  hitChanceModifier: 10 
}

// Knight's Charge - harder to hit (-10%)
{ 
  name: 'Charge', 
  damage: 20, 
  hitChanceModifier: -10 
}
```

**Hit Chance Calculation:**
```javascript
function calculateHitChance(targetDefense, abilityModifier = 0) {
  const baseHitChance = 85;
  const defenseReduction = targetDefense * 1.5;
  const hitChance = Math.max(20, Math.min(95, 
    baseHitChance - defenseReduction + abilityModifier
  ));
  return Math.round(hitChance);
}
```

**Balance Examples:**
- **Slash:** 15 damage, +10% hit chance (reliable attack)
- **Charge:** 20 damage, -10% hit chance (risky power attack)
- **Shield Bash:** 10 damage, 0% modifier, stuns (utility)

## 🎮 **Enhanced Player Experience**

### **Victory Flow:**
1. **Combat Ends** → All enemies defeated
2. **Victory Banner** → 3-second celebration on host screen
3. **Loot Screen** → Shows on host with timer
4. **Player Prompts** → Roll/Pass buttons on player devices
5. **Roll Resolution** → Highest roll wins
6. **Next Item** → Process continues for all items
7. **New Combat** → Start next encounter with items

### **Host Screen Experience:**
```
[Combat Ends]
        ↓
[🎉 VICTORY! 🎉]
   (3 seconds)
        ↓
[Loot Screen]

```

### **Player Screen Experience:**

        ↓
[Loot Prompt]
- Item Details
- Roll/Pass Buttons
- Timer Display
        ↓
[Winner Notification]
        ↓

```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Files Modified:**

1. **`games/rpg/server.js`**
   - Fixed `endCombat()` to not send `combatEnded` on victory
   - Added victory banner event
   - Added 3-second delay before loot
   - Updated all item definitions with PNG paths
   - Added `hitChanceModifier` to abilities
   - Updated `calculateHitChance()` to accept modifier
   - Updated `resolveAttack()` to use modifier
   - Updated `getValidTargets()` to pass action data

2. **`games/rpg/client/host-scene.js`**
   - Added `showVictoryBanner()` function
   - Added victory banner animations
   - Added socket listener for `showVictoryBanner`

3. **`games/rpg/client/loot-screen.html`**
   - Removed roll/pass buttons from host view
   - Updated item icon to support PNG images
   - Added fallback system for failed images

4. **`games/rpg/client/player.js`**
   - Updated `getItemData()` with PNG paths
   - Added PNG image loading with fallback
   - Enhanced item display rendering

### **Key Functions:**

**Victory Banner:**
```javascript
function showVictoryBanner(message) {
  const banner = document.createElement('div');
  banner.style.cssText = `
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #ffd700, #ffed4e);
    font-size: 5em;
    animation: victoryPopIn 0.5s ease-out forwards;
  `;
  banner.textContent = '🎉 VICTORY! 🎉';
  // Remove after 3 seconds
  setTimeout(() => banner.remove(), 3000);
}
```

**PNG Icon Loading:**
```javascript
const img = document.createElement('img');
img.src = item.icon;
img.onerror = () => {
  iconElement.textContent = item.iconFallback;
};
```

**Hit Chance with Modifier:**
```javascript
const hitChanceModifier = action.hitChanceModifier || 0;
const hitChance = calculateHitChance(
  targetDefense, 
  hitChanceModifier
);
```

## 📊 **Balance Impact**

### **Ability Modifiers:**

**High Accuracy (Reliable):**
- Slash: +10% hit chance
- Basic attacks with lower damage

**Standard Accuracy:**
- Most abilities: 0% modifier
- Balanced risk/reward

**Low Accuracy (Risky):**
- Charge: -10% hit chance
- High damage power attacks

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Safe plays:** Use high-accuracy abilities
- **Risky plays:** Use high-damage, low-accuracy abilities
- **Tactical choice:** Balance reliability vs damage
- **Enemy defense matters:** High defense enemies harder to hit

## 🎨 **Asset Requirements**

### **Item Icons Needed:**

Create 64x64 PNG icons for:
1. `health_potion.png` - Red potion bottle
2. `vitality_ring.png` - Golden ring
3. `sharp_sword.png` - Silver sword
4. `fire_wand.png` - Flaming wand
5. `assassin_hood.png` - Dark hood
6. `iron_armor.png` - Metal armor
7. `healer_staff.png` - Wooden staff with crystal
8. `lightning_orb.png` - Electric sphere
9. `boots_swiftness.png` - Winged boots

**Fallback:** Emojis display if PNGs are missing.
