1. **Team Composition Matters**
   - Always have a Cleric for healing
   - Mix damage dealers with support classes
   - Knight is great for absorbing damage

2. **Action Economy**
   - You get 3 random actions each round
   - Plan based on what you're given
   - Coordinate with teammates

3. **Initiative is Key**
   - High speed roll = act first
   - Sometimes it's better to defend if you go early
   - Healers acting late can save lives

4. **Target Priority**
   - Focus fire on dangerous enemies
   - Protect low HP allies
   - Use crowd control effectively
