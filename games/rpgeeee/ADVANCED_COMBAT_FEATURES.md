# ⚔️ Advanced Combat Features Complete

## Overview

I've implemented advanced combat mechanics including charge-up abilities, enemy special abilities with visual indicators, dead enemy removal, and speed roll modifiers.

## ✅ **Features Implemented**

### 1. **Charge-Up Abilities** ✅

**Mechanic:**
- Abilities can have a 1-turn charge-up period
- Do nothing on the round they're used
- Resolve at the beginning of the following round
- Sprite locked in 'cast' mode while charging

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// In action definition
{
  name: 'Mega Blast',
  damage: 50,
  chargeUp: true,  // Marks as charge-up ability
  type: 'attack'
}
```

**Charging Flow:**
1. **Round 1:** Player selects charge-up ability
2. **Sprite Changes:** Locked to 'cast' animation
3. **Visual Feedback:** Sprite brightens (filter: brightness(1.2))
4. **Round 2:** Ability resolves automatically at start
5. **Sprite Returns:** Back to normal state

**Server Logic:**
```javascript
if (action.chargeUp && !player.chargingAbility) {
  player.chargingAbility = {
    action: action,
    targetId: targetId
  };
  // Sprite stays in cast mode
}
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- Sprite locked in cast pose
- Brightness increased
- Persists across rounds
- Automatically releases when ability fires

### 2. **Enemy Special Abilities** ✅

**System:**
- Enemies can have optional special ability pools
- Weighted selection (e.g., 10% chance)
- Determined at beginning of round
- Visual indicator shows players

**Enemy Definitions:**
```javascript
{
  name: 'Troll',
  specialAbilities: [
    {
      id: 'bash',
      name: 'Bash',
      damage: 20,
      damageType: 'physical',
      stun: true,
      target: 'single_player',
      weight: 10  // 10% chance
    }
  ]
}
```

**Special Abilities Added:**

**Troll - Bash:**
- 20 physical damage
- Stuns target
- 10% chance to use
- Single target

**Dark Wizard - Shadow Bolt:**
- 12 magic damage
- Hits ALL players
- 10% chance to use
- Area of effect

**Visual Indicator:**
- ⚠️ Orange pulsing icon
- Appears on enemy health bar
- Shows ability name on hover
- Pulses to draw attention

**Animation:**
```css
@keyframes pulseWarning {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: scale(1);
    box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.5);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.1);
    box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.8);
  }
}
```

**Strategic Impact:**
- Players can see special ability coming
- Can adjust tactics accordingly
- Adds tension and decision-making
- Rewards paying attention

### 3. **Dead Enemy Removal** ✅

**Implementation:**
- Enemies fade out when health reaches 0
- 0.5s opacity transition
- Sprite removed from DOM after fade
- Smooth visual experience

**Code:**
```javascript
if (enemy.health <= 0 && sprite) {
  sprite.style.transition = 'opacity 0.5s ease-out';
  sprite.style.opacity = '0';
  setTimeout(() => {
    sprite.remove();
  }, 500);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner battlefield display
- Clear visual feedback
- No clutter from dead enemies
- Professional polish

### 4. **Speed Roll Modifiers** ✅

**New Item Type:**
- Items can increase speed rolls
- Flat modifier added to 1d20
- Persistent across all combats
- Stacks with other items

**New Item:**
```javascript
haste_amulet: {
  name: 'Amulet of Haste',
  description: 'Increases speed rolls by 3',
  rarity: 'rare',
  effects: {
    speedRoll: 3  // +3 to all speed rolls
  }
}
```

**Speed Roll Calculation:**
```javascript
const speedRollModifier = player.itemEffects?.speedRoll || 0;
const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1 + speedRollModifier;
// Example: 1d20 + 3 = 4-23 range
```

**Strategic Value:**
- Higher initiative more often
- Act before enemies
- Synergizes with high-damage builds
- Valuable for all classes

## 🎮 **Enhanced Combat Experience**

### **Charge-Up Ability Flow:**
```
Round 1:
Player: "I'll use Mega Blast!"
[Sprite locks to cast pose]
[Sprite brightens]
Combat Log: "Player begins charging Mega Blast!"

Round 2:
[Ability fires automatically]
[Massive damage dealt]
[Sprite returns to normal]
Combat Log: "Player unleashes Mega Blast for 50 damage!"
```

### **Enemy Special Ability Flow:**
```
Initiative Roll:
[Troll rolls for special ability]
[10% chance - SUCCESS!]
[⚠️ Icon appears on Troll]

Player Response:
"Oh no, Troll is preparing Bash!"
"Let's stun it first!"
"Or focus on defense!"

Troll's Turn:
[Bash executes]
[20 damage + stun]
[Target stunned for 1 round]
```

### **Visual Indicators:**

- Sprite: Cast pose
- Effect: Brightened
- Duration: Until ability fires

  };
  return chargeLog;
}

for (const player of Object.values(lobby.state.players)) {
  if (player.chargingAbility && player.health > 0) {
    const result = executePlayerAction(lobby, player,

      player.chargingAbility.targetId);
    player.chargingAbility = null;
  }
}

// Client - Lock sprite
if (player.chargingAbility) {
  changeSpriteState(sprite, 'cast');
  sprite.classList.add('charging');
}
```

**Enemy Special Abilities:**
```javascript
// Server - Select ability
if (enemy.specialAbilities && enemy.specialAbilities.length > 0) {
  const roll = Math.random() * 100;
  let cumulativeWeight = 0;
  
  for (const ability of enemy.specialAbilities) {
    cumulativeWeight += ability.weight;
    if (roll < cumulativeWeight) {
      enemy.specialAbilityQueued = ability;
      break;
    }
  }
}

// Server - Execute special ability
function executeEnemySpecialAbility(lobby, enemy, ability, animationData) {
  if (ability.target === 'all_players') {
    alivePlayers.forEach(target => {
      // Damage all players
    });
  } else if (ability.target === 'single_player') {
    // Damage single player + stun
  }
}

function updateSpecialAbilityIndicator(enemyId, abilityName) {

  }
}
```

if (enemy.health <= 0 && sprite) {
  sprite.style.transition = 'opacity 0.5s ease-out';
  sprite.style.opacity = '0';

    sprite.remove();
  }, 500);
  return; // Skip other updates
}
```

**Speed Roll Modifier:**
```javascript
const speedRollModifier = player.itemEffects?.speedRoll || 0;
const roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1 + speedRollModifier;
