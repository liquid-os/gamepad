# üß™ Testing Co-op RPG Quest

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Add Game to Database

First, you need to populate the game in your MongoDB database:

```bash
npm run populate-games
```

This will scan the `games/` folder and add the RPG game to your database.

### 2. Grant Access (Optional)

To make the game free for all users:

```bash
npm run grant-free-games
```

Or you can purchase it in the game store with coins.

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
# or for development
npm run dev
```

### 4. Testing Workflow

#### A. Solo Testing (Same Device)
1. Open browser tab 1: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login/register
3. Click "Host Game (TV Screen)" - opens in new tab
4. Note the 4-letter lobby code
5. Open browser tab 2: `http://localhost:3000`
6. Click "Join as Player"
7. Enter lobby code
8. Select a class
9. **Important:** Open more tabs to add more players (minimum 2 required)

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Game Doesn't Appear in Store
**Problem:** RPG not showing in game selection  
**Fix:** Run `npm run populate-games` to add to database

### Can't Select Actions
**Problem:** Action buttons not appearing  
**Fix:** Make sure you're a player (not host) and class was selected

### Host Screen Not Updating
**Problem:** Host view not showing game state  
**Fix:** Check `hostGameUpdate` events in browser console

### Players Can't Join
**Problem:** "Lobby not found" error  
**Fix:** 
- Verify lobby code is correct (4 letters)
- Make sure host is still connected
- Check Socket.IO connection in browser console

### Combat Doesn't Start
**Problem:** Stuck in class selection  
**Fix:** All players must select a class (need minimum 2 players)

## Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging in browser console:

```javascript
// In player.js, add this at the top
console.log('Debug mode enabled');

// Check socket connection
socket.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Socket connected:', socket.id);
});

socket.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Socket disconnected');
});
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Test with 6 players (max)
- Multiple combat rounds
- Watch for memory leaks
- Check socket disconnection handling

### Mobile Testing
- Test on iOS Safari
- Test on Android Chrome
- Check touch interactions
- Verify responsive design

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Combat Only**: Currently only one combat phase implemented
2. **No Save/Load**: Game state not persisted
3. **Basic Enemy AI**: Enemies attack randomly
4. **No Items Yet**: Item system not implemented
5. **No Reconnection**: Players can't rejoin if disconnected during combat

## Next Steps After Testing

Once basic combat works:
1. Add camp phase (rest between combats)
2. Add shop phase (buy items)
3. Add puzzle phase (team challenges)
4. Implement item system
5. Add boss battles
6. Create story campaign

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, include:
- Browser/device used
- Number of players
- Phase when error occurred
- Console error messages
- Steps to reproduce
