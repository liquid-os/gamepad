### Animation Flow

**Example: Knight attacks Orc**
```
1. Knight sprite changes to "attack" pose
2. Knight sprite moves 60% toward Orc
3. [400ms pause]
4. Knight sprite moves back to original position
5. [300ms pause]
6. Knight sprite changes to "idle" pose
7. Orc sprite shakes (if hit)
8. Orc health bar decreases
9. Combat log updates
```

**Example: Wizard casts Fireball**
```
1. Wizard sprite changes to "cast" pose
2. [500ms casting time]
3. Fireball effect appears over Goblin
4. Effect fades in
5. [2000ms effect visible]
6. Effect fades out
7. Wizard sprite changes to "idle"
8. Goblin sprite shakes (if hit)
9. Goblin health bar decreases
10. Combat log updates
```

## Using the Animated Host

### Option 1: Set as Default Host View

Update how RPG game loads the host view. In your main game serving code, use:
- Player view: `games/rpg/client/index.html` (unchanged)
- Host view: `games/rpg/client/host-scene.html` (new animated version)

### Option 2: Keep Both Options

- **UI Version:** `host.html` (original, works in main host.html)
- **Scene Version:** `host-scene.html` (new, full-screen animated)

Players choose which to use!

## Animation Timing

All animations work with the 2.5s action delays:

```
Action trigger (t=0s)
  ↓
Animation starts (t=0.3s)
  ↓
Animation completes (t=1-3s)
  ↓
Combat log updates (t=2s)
  ↓
Wait for next action (t=2.5s)
  ↓
Next action
```

Perfect timing - animations complete before next action!

## Customization

### Change Background

Edit line in `host-scene.html`:
```css
background-image: url('/games/rpg/assets/backgrounds/forest.jpg');

/* Change to: */
background-image: url('/games/rpg/assets/backgrounds/dungeon.jpg');
```

### Adjust Sprite Sizes

Edit `SPRITE_CONFIG` in `host-scene.js`:
```javascript
player: {
  baseWidth: 120,   // Change sprite width
  baseHeight: 120,  // Change sprite height
  // ...
}
```

### Modify Animation Speed

```javascript
// Melee speed
await sleep(400);  // Faster: 200, Slower: 600

// Projectile speed
projectile.style.transition = 'all 0.8s linear';
// Faster: 0.4s, Slower: 1.5s

// Effect duration
await sleep(2000);  // Shorter: 1000, Longer: 3000
```

## Visual Hierarchy

**Z-Index Layers:**
- Background: -1 (furthest back)
- Battle overlay: 0 (darkening)
- Sprites: 10 (characters)
- Projectiles: 50 (flying objects)
- Effects: 60 (spell impacts)
- Combat log: 90 (always visible)
- Title bar: 100 (always on top)
- Turn indicator: 80
- Class selection: 200 (full overlay)

## Accessibility Features

### Emoji Fallbacks
- No assets needed to play
- Clear visual feedback
- Works immediately
- Professional look with assets

### Responsive Design
- Sprites position based on screen size
- Combat log adapts to width
- Works on different resolutions

## Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization
- Use compressed JPG for backgrounds
- Use PNG with transparency for sprites
- Keep sprites under 50KB each
- Total assets < 5MB recommended

### Animation Performance
- CSS transitions (GPU accelerated)
- Limit concurrent animations
- Clean up removed elements
- Cap combat log at 20 entries

## Testing the Animated Scene

### 1. Test Without Assets (Emoji Mode)
```bash
npm start
```

1. Host game
2. Open: `http://localhost:3000/games/rpg/client/host-scene.html`
3. Join with players
4. Watch emoji sprites battle!

### 2. Test With Assets

1. Add at least one background image
2. Add at least one sprite (e.g., `knight_idle.png`)
3. Refresh host screen
4. Watch the sprite appear!

### 3. Test Animations

1. Start combat
2. Select different action types:
   - Melee (Slash) - Watch sprite move
   - Projectile (Arrow) - Watch arrow fly
   - Spell (Fireball) - Watch effect appear
3. Watch sprites shake when hit
4. See critical hits in combat log

## Comparing Versions

### UI Version (Original)
- Clean boxes and health bars
- Professional dashboard look
- Always works perfectly
- No assets needed

### Scene Version (New)
- Cinematic battle presentation
- Animated sprites and effects
- More engaging to watch
- Optional: works with or without assets

**Both are fully functional!** Choose based on preference.

## Asset Creation Workflow

### For Non-Artists:

1. **Week 1:** Use emoji fallbacks, test gameplay
2. **Week 2:** Find free background images online
3. **Week 3:** Commission or AI-generate sprite set
4. **Week 4:** Add effects and polish

### For Artists:

1. **Day 1:** Sketch character concepts
2. **Day 2:** Create base sprites (idle)
3. **Day 3:** Create action poses (attack, cast, hurt)
4. **Day 4:** Create enemy sprites
5. **Day 5:** Create effects and projectiles
6. **Day 6:** Find/create backgrounds
7. **Day 7:** Polish and refine

### For Developers:

The system is done! Just drop assets in folders:
```
games/rpg/assets/backgrounds/forest.jpg     → Background changes
games/rpg/assets/sprites/knight_idle.png    → Knight appears
games/rpg/assets/sprites/knight_attack.png  → Attack animation works
games/rpg/assets/effects/effect_fireball.png → Fireball effect appears
```

No code changes needed!

## Quick Win: Add Just a Background

1. Find any 1920x1080 fantasy image
2. Save as `games/rpg/assets/backgrounds/forest.jpg`
3. Refresh host screen
4. **Instant improvement!** Battle scene has atmosphere!

Even with emoji sprites, a good background makes it look amazing!

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test emoji version (works now!)
2. ⏳ Add background image
3. ⏳ Add player sprites
4. ⏳ Add enemy sprites
5. ⏳ Add effects
6. ⏳ Polish and refine
