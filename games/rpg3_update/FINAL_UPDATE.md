## How It Works

### Flow:

```
Server: Action executes
  ↓
Server: Sends animateAction event with:
  { 
    actorId, 
    targetId, 
    damage: 25,
    hit: true,
    crit: false,
    heal: 0
  }
  ↓
Host: Plays animation
  ↓
Host: At impact moment, spawns floating text
  ↓
Host: Text floats up for 2 seconds
  ↓
Host: Text auto-removes
  ↓
Next action
```

### Perfect Timing:

```
Action starts (t=0s)
Animation plays (t=0-1s)
  ↓ Impact moment
Floating text spawns (t=0.4-0.8s)
Text visible (t=0.4-2.4s)
  ↓
Action complete (t=2.5s)
Next action starts
```

Text is always visible during action, fades before next!

## Test It Now!

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Host game and select RPG**

3. **Watch for floating text:**
   - Normal hits: Red numbers
