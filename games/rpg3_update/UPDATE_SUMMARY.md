## Combat Mechanics Summary

### Defense Formula
```
Hit Chance = 85% - (Target Defense ÷ 2)
Min: 20%, Max: 95%

Examples:
  vs Defense 5:  83% hit
  vs Defense 10: 80% hit
  vs Defense 15: 78% hit
  vs Defense 18: 76% hit
```

```
Crit Chance: 5% (fixed)
Crit Damage: Base Damage × 2

Example:
  Backstab: 30 damage normal
           60 damage on crit!
```

   ↓
2. Roll for crit (5% chance)
   ↓
   If crit → Double damage, show "⚡ CRITICAL HIT!"
   ↓
3. Apply damage to target
   ↓
4. Update health bars

## Strategic Depth

### Class Strengths
- **Knight:** Hardest to hit (15 def), great tank
- **Rogue:** Can become very evasive (12 + evade buff = 32!)
- **Wizard:** Fragile but hits hard, glass cannon
- **Cleric:** Can buff allies' defense with Bless

### Enemy Tactics
- **Troll:** Highest defense (18), hard to kill quickly
- **Wolf:** Low defense (7), easy to hit but fast
- **Dark Wizard:** Low defense, high damage - priority target!

### Decision Making
```
Question: "Attack Orc (79% hit) or Troll (76% hit)?"

Consider:
  - Orc has less HP (easier to finish)
  - Troll has more HP (longer fight)
  - 3% difference in hit chance
  - Risk vs reward!
```

## Testing Results

**Misses:**
- Should happen ~15-25% of the time
- More common against high defense targets
- Shows as "MISS!" in combat log
