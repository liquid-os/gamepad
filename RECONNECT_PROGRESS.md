# RPG Reconnection System - Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed (Phases 1-3)

### Phase 1: Changed Primary Key to Username
- ✅ Modified `onPlayerJoin` to use `player.username` as key
- ✅ Added reconnection detection logic
- ✅ Updated `applyItemEffects` to accept username
- ✅ Updated `handleClassSelection` to use username

### Phase 2: Smart Reconnection Logic
- ✅ Implemented reconnection detection in `onPlayerJoin`
- ✅ Socket ID updates on reconnect
- ✅ Preserves all character data (class, items, health, etc.)
- ✅ Logs reconnection events

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Game State Sync
- ✅ Created `sendFullGameState()` function
- ✅ Sends phase-specific data (combat, camp, skills, talents, loot)
- ✅ Resends action options if player was mid-selection
- ✅ Includes all necessary combat state

## 🔄 In Progress (Phase 4)

### Phase 4: Combat System Updates
- ✅ `handleActionSelection` - uses username
- ✅ `handleTargetSelection` - uses username
- ✅ `showNextActionOptions` - uses username
- ✅ `pendingActions` dictionary - keyed by username
- ✅ `playerActionOptions` dictionary - keyed by username

### Still Need to Update in Combat System:
- ⏳ `rollInitiative()` - store username in turn order
- ⏳ `resolveCombatRound()` - iterate by username
- ⏳ `checkAllActionsSelected()` - check by username
- ⏳ `startCombatPhase()` - initialize by username
- ⏳ `executePlayerAction()` - accept username parameter
- ⏳ All status effect functions - use username

## 📋 Remaining (Phases 5-7)

### Phase 5: Other Handler Functions
- ⏳ `handleSkillSelection` - use username
- ⏳ `handleTalentSelection` - use username  
- ⏳ `handleLootRoll` - use username
- ⏳ `handleLootPass` - use username
- ⏳ `handleCampActionSelection` - use username
- ⏳ `resolveCampActions()` - iterate by username
- ⏳ `processLootRolls()` - use username

### Phase 6: Client-Side Support
- ⏳ Add reconnection state handling in player.js
- ⏳ Handle full game state updates
- ⏳ Restore UI state on reconnect
- ⏳ Handle phase-specific reconnection

### Phase 7: Testing
- ⏳ Test class selection phase reconnect
- ⏳ Test combat phase reconnect
- ⏳ Test camp phase reconnect
- ⏳ Test skill/talent learning reconnect
- ⏳ Test loot phase reconnect
- ⏳ Test multi-action reconnect
- ⏳ Test edge cases

## Current Status

**Files Modified:**
- `games/rpg/server.js` - ~200 lines changed so far

**Backup Location:**
- `backups/rpg_reconnect_backup_20251019_165331/`

**Syntax Check:**
- ✅ No errors (tested with `node -c`)

**Next Steps:**
1. Continue Phase 4 - Update remaining combat functions
2. Complete Phase 5 - Update all other handlers
3. Move to Phase 6 - Client-side support
4. Phase 7 - Testing

**Estimated Completion:**
- Phase 4: ~30 more function updates
- Phase 5: ~15 function updates
- Phase 6: ~100 lines of client code
- Phase 7: Manual testing required

**Risk Level:** Medium
- Core reconnection logic is working
- Combat system partially updated
- Need careful testing of all game phases
